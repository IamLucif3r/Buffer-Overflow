## Buffer Overflow - Everything You Should Know about BOF
A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs when you give a program too much data. The excess data corrupts nearby space in memory and may alter other data. As a result, the program might report an error or behave differently. Such vulnerabilities are also called buffer overrun.

## Types of Buffer Overflow Attacks
- <b>Stack-based</b> buffer overflows are more common, and leverage stack memory that only exists during the execution time of a function.

- <b>Heap-based </b> attacks are harder to carry out and involve flooding the memory space allocated for a program beyond memory used for current runtime operations.
